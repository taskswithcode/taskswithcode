> _Machine learning [researchers and practitioners]([https://authorswithcode.com](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/)) contributing to open source are the **true catalysts** fueling the rapid growth in AI. Their contributions have paved the way for innovations across industries, with many corporations benefiting greatly from this open collaboration._

> _It could be a strategic advantage for businesses leveraging machine learning to directly invest in these [researchers and practitioners](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/?choice=Top%20Repo%20Authors%20Open%20for%20Sponsorship%20%F0%9F%92%8E). Especially those who share code and models with licenses that encourage widespread use. Presently, while use of open source with permissible licenses primarily requires just attribution from companies, businesses can demonstrate their commitment to innovation and benefit even more by actively investing in the vibrant community that propels their advancements._

 [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors#regions) is one way to directly support [them](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/?choice=Top%20Repo%20Authors%20Open%20for%20Sponsorship%20%F0%9F%92%8E). 
However, the majority of them (~98%) have not enabled sponsorship yet.  At this point, the only show of support we can offer is to star their repos. 

This initiative pursues two primary objectives: 
- Firstly, to inspire both individuals and businesses to sponsor [researchers and practitioners](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/?choice=Top%20Repo%20Authors%20Open%20for%20Sponsorship%20%F0%9F%92%8E)
- Secondly, to encourage [researchers and practitioners]([https://authorswithcode.com](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/)) to activate [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors#regions), creating a direct channel for us to reward their work
