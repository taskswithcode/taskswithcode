We spotlight [Authors With Code](https://authorswithcode.com), make it easier to find solutions for [Tasks (With Code)](https://taskswithcode.com/find_sota_repos/), and enable learners to grasp [Concepts With Code](https://conceptswithcode.com). _These initiatives are work in progress_


### What is the AuthorsWithCode initiative?

> _Machine learning [researchers and practitioners]([https://authorswithcode.com](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/)) contributing to open source are the **true catalysts** AI progress. Their contributions have paved the way for innovations across industries, with many corporations benefiting significantly from this open collaboration._

> _It could be a strategic advantage for businesses leveraging machine learning to directly invest in these [researchers and practitioners](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/?choice=Top%20Repo%20Authors%20Open%20for%20Sponsorship%20%F0%9F%92%8E). Especially those who share code and models with licenses that encourage widespread use. Presently, while use of open source with permissible licenses primarily requires just attribution from companies, businesses can demonstrate their commitment to innovation and benefit even more by actively investing in the community that propels their advancements._

 [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors#regions) is one  direct way to accomplish this. 
However, the majority of them (~98%) have not enabled sponsorship yet.  At this point, all we can do is a symbolic gesture of support by  starring their repos.

AuthorsWithCode pursues two primary objectives: 
1. To inspire both individuals and businesses to sponsor [researchers and practitioners.](https://authorswithcode.com/top100/?choice=Top%20Repo%20Authors%20Open%20for%20Sponsorship%20%F0%9F%92%8E)
2. To create a direct channel for both rewarding and investing in them by encouraging them to activate [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors#regions).

An auxiliary objective is to fill the current gap in finding both paper and code contributions by an author in one place - an author-centric view. This gap is not covered by [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), which focuses primarily on citations. Additionally, Google Scholar overlooks an important segment that contributes to open-source implementations of papers: practitioners, some of whom have never published a single paper. [Paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/), in contrast, provides a paper-centric view with links to accompanying code, encompassing both researchers and practitioners

We address these objectives with an [app](https://authorswithcode.com)  [![app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taskswithcode/image_assets/main/.github/images/TWCAWC.svg)](https://authorswithcode.com) that facilitates the discovery of these contributors and simplifies the process of investing in them.

_Authorswithcode relies on openly published data from paperswithcode, to create an author-centric view by combining it with GitHub data available through APIs._
